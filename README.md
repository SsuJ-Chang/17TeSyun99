## Core Features
* Multiple Playes Online Game
* Chatroom

## Language
* Frontend: Javascript
* Backend: Node.js

## How to implement gameplay mechanics 
### Client Side
* Transporting player data by **Socket.IO** client
* Rendering game view by **HTML5 Canvas API**
  * Background images
  * Player's ball-ship (controller)
  * All other player's ball-ships (enemies)
  * All bullets 
* Implementing 60 FPS by **JavaScript `setInterval()`**

> Client will render player's ball-ship according to the latest player data in client for ***making sure player's ball-ship moving smoothly***. 

### Server Side
* Transporting game data by **Socket.IO** server
  * Players data
  * Leaderboard
  * Bullets data
* Implementing fixed server updating frequency by **JavaScript `setInterval()`**

> In order to decrease unnecessary packets transporting, the game data will broadcast after the ***`isPlayersInfoChanged` flag*** becoming ***true***.
